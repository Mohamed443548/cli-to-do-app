cli to-do app

File Handling: I used open() to save and load tasks from a text file so that my tasks donâ€™t disappear when I close the program.

Functions: I created small functions for each work like adding, removing, viewing tasks to keep my code neat and easy to read.

Lists: I used a list to store all tasks temporarily in memory while the program is running.

Loops and Menu: I used a while loop with menu options to keep asking the user until they exit.

Try-Except: I used try-except to handle errors, like when the file is not found or wrong input is given.

If-Else Conditions: I used if-else statements to check user choices and to validate task numbers.

Main Block: I added if __name__ == "__main__": to run my program safely when it is executed directly.
